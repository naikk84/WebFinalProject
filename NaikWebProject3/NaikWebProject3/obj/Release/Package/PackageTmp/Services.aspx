                <h4>Photometric Studies</h4>
                <h6>Photometric light study is the study of light itself, not just a type of lighting. Photometrics, photometric analysis and photometric studies are just different names of the same thing. It focuses on how a light leaves a fixture and goes into the surrounding area it is in. Which gives our Customer a better idea about what we are exactly talking about.</h6>

                <h4>Lighting Layouts</h4>
                <h6>Lighting is an integral part of any architectural scheme and should be coordinated with the interior features. The primary elements of a lighting design consist of point sources, linear sources, planar sources, or volumetric sources. Volumetric sources provide ambient light; linear and planar sources provide general illumination, and point sources provide specific task lighting. A lighting layout coordinates the fixture locations with diffusers, return grilles, speakers, sprinkler heads, and other structural elements.</h6>

                <h4>Design Services</h4>
                <h6>Design service is the activity of planning and organizing people, infrastructure, communication and material components of a service in order to improve its quality and the interaction between the service provider and its customers. Design service may function as a way to inform changes to an existing service or create a new service entirely.</h6>

                <h4>Site Survey</h4>
                <h6>During a site survey we have a clear look at the infrastructure and also decide the areas where the lights can be installed in order to get the best result. During a site survey we create a rough plan and design of what exactly can be done to make your home or workplace a fun place to be.</h6>

                <h4>Installation</h4>
                <h6>With all the design part being done the next step is to execute the plans and designs that are on paper to on-site. Here our experienced technicians and electricians will install the LED lights as per the design.</h6>
